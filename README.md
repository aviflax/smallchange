* Think about curation
** Maybe with some kind of a panel
* Add mission statement
* Addd “about” page with story/narrative
** democratizing charitable contributions
** systematic
** proactive not reactive
* Look into שבת


## Copy/UI Ideas
* Consider emphasizing:
** No commitment
** No pledges
** Personal
* More visual, less textual
** Represent disbursements with a live chart
** Represent disbursement history graphically somehow
** Browse locations — map of the world
** See menu of Naked Pizza in Boston


## Roadmap
* Groups
* “Spotlight” — featured causes
* Updates from Causes
* Community
* Drives


## Feature Ideas
* Integrate with payroll systems
** let people choose to contribute a fixed amount or a percentage of their paycheck to their personal charitable fund — an alternative to the automatic bank account transfers
* Ways to give things other than money
** meals, things
** volunteer time

## Where do you give? submission

### Image ideas
* Maybe the visual chart/graph which shows where you’ve given over time
