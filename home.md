# GiveDaily

GiveDaily is a platform and a community designed to help you make small daily contributions to your personal charitable fund and make monthly disbursements to worthy causes from your fund.

## How it Works

1. You decide how much and how often you’ll contribute to your personal fund.

2. You decide which causes should get how much of your monthly disbursement. (We’ll help you find causes which resonate with you.)

3. Every day, we automatically debit your chosen amount from your bank account and put it into your personal charity fund.

4. At the end of each month, we disburse your funds to the causes you’ve chosen, and send you a report.

5. 100% of your contributions go to your chosen causes; there are absolutely no fees of any kind.

6. You can change your choices, withdraw your funds, or cancel your account at any time. It’s your money and you’re in charge.

7. We make sure you get receipts for all your tax-deductible disbursements.

8. We require that recipient causes respect how you wish to be contacted.

## Why?
We feel that regular giving is a powerful way for anyone to make a real difference in the world. Many people don’t have regular opportunities to give, and it can be tough choosing what causes to support. We want to bridge these gaps by making giving automatic and smart.
